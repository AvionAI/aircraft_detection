# PREPROCESSING
# 
# In this assingment you are expected to implement 
# functions about perfromance.
#
# @TODO: implement functions such that the bounding box
# values in the metadata and the ones that are drawn with the 
# help of the model should be compared and presented.
#
# @TODO: Also evaluate the performance of the model.
# For this, your class can take the model as input and
# perform operations over it.
#
# Here you should import necessary libraries
